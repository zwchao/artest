## How to run things locally

You should run a local server, if you have python run in a console:

```
//Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

//Python 3.x
python -m http.server
```

or with node.js install the server package:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

and than run:

```
http-server . -p 8000
```
